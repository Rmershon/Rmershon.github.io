                <h3>Scalable Software Design</h3>
                <p>During this course I completed several projects, all in java. The final project that was completed was an Audio Messenger that could be linked between two computers. You could then send audio messages back and forth. A log was kept of each message between the users. This application was developed during the Fall semester of the 2015-2016 school year. It was completed along with 3 other group members.

                <h3>Scientific Computing</h3>
                <p>During this course I learned about data processing and analyzation. I honed my skills in python and reading through large, unformatted, data sets. We completed many labs that covered many different topics. Eventually I worked on a final project that involved SIR modeling of the Ebola virus. My partner and I wrote a final paper on this which you can read at the link below.

                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>During game development I used Unity3D to develop interactive games. Each project was partner based and, for the most part, was kept on GitHub. We moved from 2D sprite animations and games to much more complex 3D animated games. We culminated at a 72-hour game jam (Ludum Dare). During this jam we were given a community picked theme and then given 72-hours to complete the game pertaining to said theme. Our theme was 'small world' so we created a 3D game where the objective was to avoid people you 'knew' in the store. You can check out several of the projects below.

                This is the first project from the class. <br>

                And this was the final project that we completed. <br>

                <h3>Senior Research</h3>
                <p>During this semester, Fall of 2017, I am conducting a year long research into the indentification of bots on Twitter. I am using a large data set of over 5.5 million tweets from approx. 36,000 accounts. Using this data I will learn what differentiates a bot from a real account. Through my current readings of previous research on this topic, I have found that none have implemented sentiment analysis into their qualifications. So what I am proposing is that these bot accounts will tend to have a higher average sentiment, either positive or negative, when compared to real users sentiment. This is because real users may go through different emotions. In order to do this I will need to implement some natural language processing and use machine learning algorithms to help quantify the bot accounts for future identification. As I write my paper it will be updated and linked on here. </p>
